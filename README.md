== Get Weather Data ==
This is a simple example for data gathering and analysis in Python. 

In this notebook, we will gather weather data according to the tutorial presented in https://stackabuse.com/using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-weather-part-1/, and use openweather insted of the weather underground's data, since their API has been deprecated as of 2020.

You can also check on the docs folder in the main tree of this file to see further references in the topic.
